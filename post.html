                        <p>The legendary princess, Andromeda, was a mortal woman born to King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia. Andromeda’s fate was sealed when Cassiopeia bragged that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereid sea nymphs. The Nereid sea nymphs were known for their astounding beauty. Poseidon, the god of the sea, was a friend of the Nereids. </p>
                        <p>These arrogant statements by Cassiopeia angered Poseidon. When Poseidon heard that Cassiopeia was bragging that her daughter, Andromeda, was more beautiful than the Nereids, Poseidon sent a sea monster upon the land to ravage the princess as revenge.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> Perseus rescues Andromeda</h2>
                        <p>As Perseus was on his way home from beheading the monster Medusa, he noticed Andromeda was chained to a rock and was facing being eaten from the sea monster Cetus. Perseus was captivated by her beauty and decided to rescue her. With the head of Medusa in his satchel, he pulled out Medusa’s head and showed it to the sea monster. Cetus, the sea monster, looked into the eyes of the head of Medusa and turned to stone, releasing Andromeda from her imminent death.</p>
                        <h3 class="section-heading"> Andromeda Marries Perseus</h3>
                        <p> Andromeda was arranged to marry Phineus, her uncle, but Perseus could not let that happen. He had fallen in love with her the moment he saw her chained to the rock. After rescuing her, Perseus married Andromeda and killed Phineus in the process. Phineus attempted to fight Perseus for Andromeda, but Perseus killed Phineus by using Medusa’s head to turn him to stone. After they married, Andromeda and Perseus ventured Greece together.</p>
                        <h4 class="section-heading"> Andromeda's Place in the Sky</h4>
                        <p> Athena promises that Andromeda will have a place in the sky after her death. When Andromeda dies, Athena keeps her promise and places Andromeda in the sky within the Andromeda constellation. The Andromeda constellation is fittingly located between the Perseus constellation and the Cassiopeia constellation.</p>
